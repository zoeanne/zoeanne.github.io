        <h1>Guardian Angels By My Side: True Stories of Angelic Encounters and Divine Interventions</h1>
        <h2>BY BARBARA LOVE</h2>
        <p>
          When angel encounters happened in my own family, with healing messages for me, and with my Son's angel appearing to him at the age of six, I began sharing our story with others. As they listened, many then began sharing their own miraculous stories with me. These are true stories about life changing, divine interventions and angelic encounters. When angels appeared, many came with beautiful, and inspirational messages, full of loving guidance. Some stories are about individuals who were saved by their guardian angel. In some instances, their divine intervention helped to change the course they were on in their lives through the messages given to them by their angel. Many went on to complete their life's destiny because of their blessed experience. God has blessed us by providing each and every one of us guardian angels to guide and protect us throughout our lifetimes, until the day an angel leads our soul back to Heaven with God. As you read about these heavenly interventions, you will be inspired by each one of these beautiful and amazing stories.
